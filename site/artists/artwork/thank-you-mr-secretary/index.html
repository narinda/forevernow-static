      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Heinz Riegler is an Austrian born musician, composer and multidisciplinary artist working between Australia and Europe. First emerging as a songwriter and performer in the late 1980s, Riegler has since expanded his output across video, installation and visual art. Riegler currently investigates concepts of utilitarian composition, rendering ambient improvisations through a variety of analogue and digital instrumentation, inviting the audience to reconsider how it comes to understand that which surrounds it.</p>

<p>In recent years he has exhibited an outdoor installation in the old town of Salzburg, Austria, curated and performed a three-month season of improvised live scores for Brisbane&rsquo;s Gallery of Modern Art and collaborated with painter Allyson Reynolds for a work first exhibited at the Moreton Bay Regional Gallery in Queensland, Australia. He has soundtracked a Theo Deutinger animated short film that debuted at the Netherlands Architecture Institute, created an award-winning audiovisual work filmed in alpine Austria and released several full length recordings on Room40&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Guide To Saints&rsquo; imprint. His latest work, Sunken Houses, (an interdisciplinary exhibition with photographer Brad Marsellos) is a score composed in response to the devastating 2013 Bundaberg floods, and put Riegler's practice of utilitarian (remedial) composition to work in the local community. </p>

<p>Riegler works as a solo artist/performer as well as frequent collaborator and contributor. He is an ARIA award winner, was twice short listed for the Grant McLennan Memorial Fellowship and is the co-founder of minus20degree, a biannual art and architecture festival in the Austrian Alps.</p>
