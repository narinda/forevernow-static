Contemplation of the various fragments of experience that has absorbed often produce an idea about anything and frequent emergence in the bathroom.

Contemplation is an activity or a brooding introspection of everything that happens in our day, is an activity to better identify ourselves back.

I would like to imagining any part of my brain to represent a wide range of feelings.

The sound that we&rsquo;re heard  would normally bring a perception of a things in our heads, also dominated by our feelings. When we listen to a song with the genre, example like jazz, soul, folk bossanova etc, we will feel comfortable and calm and feel as if imagining ourself in such a peaceful place in the mountains, farms, or plantations. Conversely, too, if we listen to punk music, Rhythm and Blues, Disco simultaneously we will shake the body and also sing for joy bounding expression of excitement and anarchy, This shows that music affects human behavior and imagination in mind projecting a thing of the adopted the music.
