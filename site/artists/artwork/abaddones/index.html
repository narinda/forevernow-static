        <p>Dorian Wood assembled and conducted a 45-member choir, The Difficult Women, inside an abandoned bank vault with no ventilation, during one of the hottest weekends in Los Angeles recorded history. &ldquo;Abaddones&rdquo; was born from love.</p>

      </div>
    

    
      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Los Angeles-based artist DORIAN WOOD is &ldquo;armed with a vocal charisma that would befit a preacher and an experimental streak that would make avant-gardists swoon&rdquo; (WNYC Culture). A wunderkind with a headstrong DIY discipline, Dorian has brought his emotionally-charged performances to concert halls, museums, music venues and performance spaces throughout the US, Mexico and Europe, with a voice that channels the skill and ferocity of such auteurs as Scott Walker, Nina Simone, Nick Cave and Tom Waits.</p>

<p>Born in Echo Park, California, Dorian began his musical education at a very early age, continuing his studies at Conservatorio de Castella in Costa Rica, and eventually making his way back to Los Angeles, where he first gained exposure performing on the queer bar circuit. His debut album, BOLKA, received wide critical acclaim for its impeccable merging of folk, soul, Bulgarian choral music and experimental music. His follow-up EP, Black Pig Suite, featured members of the L.A. experimental orchestra Killsonic, of which Dorian was a principal collaborator and performer for 3 years.</p>

<p>In 2010, Dorian received critical praise for his performance and &ldquo;picture perfect&rdquo; art direction (Los Angeles Times) in the Killsonic opera, Tongues Bloody Tongues, presented at the REDCAT in Los Angeles. Dorian performed at the REDCAT again in 2011 in the opera Zoophilic Follies, along with Timur and The Dime Museum. 2010 also saw the release of the album Brutus, which featured only Dorian on vocal and piano, and was recorded live at St. Giles-in-the-Fields, a church in London, in the midst of his European tour.</p>

<p>In 2011, Dorian was commissioned by LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) to present a new work for the performance series Los Angeles Goes Live, part of Pacific Standard Time. Dorian&rsquo;s performance installation, Athco, Or The Renaissance of Faggot Tree, incorporated over 30 performers, and was presented at Barnsdall Art Park. Dorian also performed with acclaimed artist Marina Abramovic in her piece An Artist&rsquo;s Life Manifesto, presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA).</p>

<p>Dorian has also performed at LACMA, UCLA, Highways Performance Space (Santa Monica), Pacific Design Center (West Hollywood), The Stone (New York City), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), Mousonturm (Frankfurt), Botanique (Brussels) and the Stockholm Fringe Fest, and he has opened for such artists as These New Puritans, Tom Brosseau, Lisa Germano, Little Annie, Baby Dee and Jason Webley, to name a few.</p>

<p>Dorian&rsquo;s latest album, Rattle Rattle, is the official studio follow-up to BOLKA. An epic collection of original doomsday-themed songs that form one strong, continuous piece (think Scott Walker re-doing Brian Wilson&rsquo;s Smile), Rattle Rattle incorporates over 60 musicians, including a 45-member choir assembled by Dorian himself, The Difficult Women, as well as guitarist Michael Corwin (Correatown), bassist Sebastian Steinberg (Soul Coughing, Fiona Apple), and trumpetist Daniel Rosenboom (Josh Groban), and featuring duets with Angela Correa (Correatown, Les Shelleys), Leah Harmon (Petrojvic Blasting Company), Eddika Organista (El Haru Kuroi) and renowned French artist Nina Savary. In 2013, Dorian directed the controversial video for the single &ldquo;La Cara Infinita&rdquo;, which features a guest appearance by actor Margaret Cho.</p>

<p>In early 2014, Dorian completed a successful five-week European tour through nine countries, backed up by a band comprised of accordionist/vocalist Leah Harmon, bassist Xavi Mu√±oz (Laetitia Sadier, A Veces Ciclon) and drummer Marcos Junquera (Daniel Johnston, Betunizer). Dorian will tour Europe again this fall in support of the release of his upcoming EP, Down, The Dirty Roof.</p>

          <p>Dorian Wood is, most likely, an alien himself.  No human of this Earth is capable of such goodness and talent.  No human can express the emotions of one or many so readily.

An absolute phenom of a musician and artist and one of the single most humble, beautiful and perfect humans i have encountered.</p>

<p>Sounds like something from BRUTUS, dark, ambient and full of terror and pathos.

          <p>Beautiful, haunting, strange, but also has a feel of the range of humanity inside of its oddity. It's an example of the human voice showing its range and versatility. It shows that there's a lot of humanity inside us that has not yet been explored and that we, to some extent, understand this. We can understand our limitations and our potential.</p>

          <p>The Radical Danish Tekno Prophet "Goodiepal' or "Gaeoudjiparl van den Dobbelsteen" suggests that, like us, alternative intelligences will be most engaged by material they are incapable of fully understanding; (in our case themes like love, death, time and the universe). In short we must puzzle them to ensure their engagement. </p>

<p>Dorian's work is complex and layered, loaded with context and connotations from which a human can draw and infer meaning, as such it provides the richest material for the an alternative intelligence to contemplate - a long term investment. </p>

<p>The voices here are like molecules of water which together create an entire ocean: the oneness of the many and the oneness of the one; it becomes a reflection of human society and history - what better way to represent us?</p>

          <p>Dorian Wood is one of the most talented Artist of this time.
<br />I had the great fortune to have worked with him several times, and I think this piece is something contemporary that brings again to light the Music of the great Masters as Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. Absolutely a gem that can grow in many different ways.</p>
