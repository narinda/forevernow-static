His mind which swung for a while is absorbed smoothly by the woman.
He will penetrate routine work, and will discover  the meaning of his life on dune, at the same time.
‘rake out sand’ is meanless. but I felt this is  symbol about psyche of Japan. that&rsquo;s the generation of a meaning which takes place by a meaningless act, and pleasure of  alive.
Since it is man, something will be found out there (meaningless).
I wished to express this beauty.
It dispels believing the importance of an act simultaneously.
