I tried to tell the story of our here , quickly, simply, without be sure..
Voices appear and become like a movement in the body and I start to believe in the necessity to repeat this sentence again and again for the forever.

On my sonore work I talk, on the life too.
If someone find my piece somewhere on the universe, they will maybe believe i&rsquo;m a God or something like that, it will be cool..
But anyway if they do not believe I will have leave a trace anyway, a trace we tell us we&rsquo;re here on the now, and we will be on the forever. Like the mini pony,  millions years ago.

        <p>Edith Perrenot ( born 1988)
I can tell you I&rsquo;m cool. I am pretty grumpy the morning but otherwise I am pretty ok.
One day I was a crazy kid, leaving on a house for crazy kids, some found Valium, me I found Art.
Its a good stuff. I study later in Mulhouse in france and I got my degree and the jury congratulate me. Was nice. At the time I was saying I wanted to do Art for everyone, for my neighbor. I am glad to create for extra terrestrial, I doubt my neighbor really understand what i&rsquo;m doing anyway.</p>

          <p>What an interesting thing to spend to space and to find for its inhabitants ! Melodic and messy, really emotionnal, and thick, raw as well as light and built. For me, this piece bring in a physical, "soundsitive" and very human way, emergency of creation and art, talk and love, humour and doubt, some perfect elements to bring in a meeting ... and probably in an extraterrestrial meeting too ... So, I think it's a nice work, and I'll be glad to be sent with. Launch !!</p>
