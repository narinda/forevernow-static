  <meta property="og:description" content="[ Music of the Spheres ] is an ancient philosophical concept that regards the constellation of celestial bodies as a system of music.
The original piece is an installation in which the constellation of the solar system is represented by synchronized light and sound which is virtually spatialized between 4 speakers.
Each planets have different length of music and it is looped with its own rotation period.

In the &ldquo;Sound of the Earth&rdquo; section of the original Golden Record, only one music is included among sound-scape tracks.
&ldquo;Music of the Spheres&rdquo; composed by Laurie Spiegel (1945- ) was themed to represent Kepler&rsquo;s theory from his book &ldquo;Harmonices Mundi&rdquo;.
In contrast to Kepler and Spiegel who had set the frequency of the Sun as 0 Herz, in my representation, 440 Herz -tuning note of orchestra- is given to the Sun.
The other notes for nine planets are set around 440 Herz with circular system.
With historic and systematic research, this piece is aimed to update the &ldquo;Music of the Spheres&rdquo;.
