  <meta property="og:description" content="force / field is a cinematic movement ritual based on the symbolism and structure of the King Wen sequence of the I Ching (Book of Changes). The multilayered composition integrates elements of the ancient Chinese divination system&rsquo;s mathematics and its interpretations relating to physics and metaphysics to create a harmonic relationship between opposing and complementary forces.

Drawing from concepts of energy and energy systems, the improvised performance is a kind of trance or meditation &ndash; a spontaneous embodiment of sound vibrations. Through the immediacy of this approach the recording captures something universally and uniquely human.

The soundtrack uses vocal samples from a 1930s 78rpm vinyl record of Russian choirs, discovered in the composer&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s shed. The song is a response to this found archive, reinvented for the present, and preserved for future discovery.

      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Adele Wilkes is a filmmaker and media artist whose work spans experimental film, documentary, narrative, multidisciplinary art. She is particularly interested in using the techniques of cinema to investigate metaphysical ideas and the mysteries of human consciousness and the cosmos.</p>

<p>Brooke Stamp is a Melbourne based dance and choreographic artist working across hybrid forms to create rich visual and sonic performance installations. Her work draws from improvisational movement practices that interrogate the hyperreal and imagined rhythms inherent to the movement of the universe. Brooke is a long term collaborator with Phillip Adams Balletlab. </p>

<p>Kane Ikin is an Australian experimental musician. A self-taught guitarist, early exposure to post punk/rock and electronic music sparked a desire for exploration beyond standard sounds, into synthesis, field recording, found sound and heavily treated signal paths. Ikin has released several critically acclaimed albums alone and as part of experimental band, Solo Andata.</p>

          <p>A harmonious ultradimensional representation of ambiguous time and space. The work is deliberately reminiscent of the state of divination in which  time collapses and the reverberant arms of possibility come out to play. This folds perfectly in with the theme of transmitting a message into the timeless unknown. The piece is itself a form of divination from the creators. It creates a macro narrative which refers to both timelessness and the intention to transmit a message through the agency of art as reflective of human will. The layers of the piece are as obvious as the arms of the dancer. Send it into space where it belongs.  </p>
