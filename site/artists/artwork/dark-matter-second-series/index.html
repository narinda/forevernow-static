  <meta property="og:description" content="Dark Matter (Second Series) is a series of combined 3D objects that are forbidden or unwelcome politically and culturally. The objects/things chosen for this series are those that are forbidden/unwelcome in Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea (some of the most censored/oppressive countries in the world). Dark Matter is intended to serve as a documentation of the lives we currently live as humans; the dark side, the invisible, the Dystopian lives that a minority (power/government) has created for a majority (people). I am interested in the idea of re-contextualizing and re-positioning these forbidden objects to another time/space. What will happen when you re-contextualize the forbidden? Through positioning the tabooed I want to re-emphasize the dramatic and ironic aspect of forbidden; When looking back in hundreds of years, how would it feel to re-visit this collection?
