  <meta property="og:description" content="ARTIST STATEMENT

Humans are deeply fascinated by the cosmos, contemplating the birth of mother earth, surmising about the afterlife, devising methods to harness divine power and imagining what exists in “outer-space”.
The human voice is the primordial tool to connect with the divine. Ascetics, shamans, priests and witches invoke spiritual chants and prayers to positively access and harness cosmological energy. Artists also believe they are conduits channeling this energy to manifest creation on the earthly plane. These represent terrestrial interpretations of consciousness and the soul, spiritual, religious or personal, as humans confront mortality, ponder the metaphysical and the interconnectedness of all things.

Based on the notion that the essence of the universe is composed of sound as vibration, I present our interstellar friends with “Incantare Mundana”: a mix-up of human voice, nature sounds, music and noise, in contradistinction to formal western music for which I have received theoretical training. The title of the work pays homage to discourse concerning the music of the spheres (musica mundana), conceiving of a cosmos ordered according to Pythagorean and Neoplatonic ideas.

Turning our consideration to the effect of music (and sound) on the soul and as a reflection of cosmic harmony, Pythagoras’ sublime speculations about sidereal harmonics and world harmony envisage the planetary bodies traversing the sky in a colossal cosmic chant. The music of the spheres imagines a universe where the revolution of each planet produces a distinctive tone, and this tonal harmony of the spheres creates a well-defined musical scale. Cosmic and musical structures are considered to express the same mathematical ratios proportioned by unequal but specific intervals. Predating the birth of Christ, this philosophy permeated thought throughout the Middle Ages, and research continues into different musical tunings and temperaments.

“Incantare” is the Latin word “to enchant”, and the derivation for the English word incantation. It references the human voice, subject matter of the field recordings, central to the composition of this sound piece.

Incantare Mundana is a poetic collection of chants, prayers and incantations personally recorded as I traversed the earth in search of the sacred. Japanese Buddhist Monks in Kyoto and Shinto Shrine Bells (bells awaken the spirits), Hindi sermons in Roman Churches, Russian prayers at Kazanski Cathedral in St Petersburg, Italian hymns intoned at The Vatican, the sweet voices of French Nuns in Paris, throat singing from the harmonic Gyuto Monks of Tibet and sacred musical sounds of the dancing Whirling Dervishes in Istanbul, Turkey.

In a time where fear dominates and humans confront planetary survival in this great cosmic disco, may this sonic offering impart a message of peace from mother earth and propel us towards a positive future paradigm!

      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Benjamin Skepper has garnered globally respect as a multi-talented creator and visionary: musician, composer, fashion model, Cultural Ambassador and Multi-Media artist.</p>

<p>A child prodigy, touring as a classical pianist, harpsichordist and cellist internationally by 10, Benjamin has independently forged his own creative path focusing on contemporary sound and composition, interdisciplinary collaborations and site-specific and multimedia installation. He has recorded for labels including Colombia Music and Ninja Tunes, written music for film and TV, received commissions from Electrolux, Dom Pérignon, Yohji Yamamoto and The Victorian Arts Centre, lived as an artist-in-residence at The French Embassy Tokyo, played in Palaces and Museums across Europe, and exhibited sound installations alongside avant-garde artists such as Yoko Ono.</p>

<p>Committed to harnessing the power of art and culture to effect social change, Benjamin is co-developing the first ever artist-in-residency program for Australian artists with the Australian Ambassador in Moscow, and continues his research collaborations into the intersections between science, technology, art and synaesthesia.</p>

<p>“Embodying classical aesthetic, music and culture, Benjamin Skepper is a musician with an extraordinary sense of the contemporary” (Rolling Stone Italy 2011)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worldly, experimental and blurring the lines between visual art, music and other art forms, Benjamin Skepper’s performance at MOFO embodied the festival and the MONA brand&rdquo;  (ArtsHub 2013)</p>

          <p>This is such a fabulous piece that captures the essence of our human longing to be reconnected to something greater than our selves, at the same time as giving the listener a glimpse into the feeling of that coveted connection.

          <p>Simply stunning piece! I love most of all the different sounds harmonizing and creating sound layers, a feeling like hovering among familiar but unknown places, and viewing the earth next to light and wind while gathering sounds. This music recalls and echoes our spirits, surrounds us by gentle waves, and will unite the earth beyond our belief and religions. I believe all elements surrounding us have their own undulation, harmonizing with each other, and reaching towards infinity. This artwork communicates the possibility of life-form beyond earth.</p>

          <p>Fortunately for me I have been to many of Benjamin's Performances. Each one different and  each one at a different and diverse venue. Benjamin has explained in detail how he has created all of the sounds we hear in the small amount of sound posted here. From my perspective of being in his audiences I can try and explain how his interpretation of life, nature and sound have affected me and the people surrounding me. We were all transfixed by the magic of  what Benjamin has created from such natural sounds that we hear everyday in the outside world. Even though at the performances I was at were indoors, I felt like I was in a field filled with the wonderous sounds of nature. Ben weaves a magical spell around all who share in these performances. My only regret is not being able to see Ben perform in Japan outside at the Shrines, but thank goodness we can all view this and many more extraordinary performances of Benjamin via You Tube. I would like to mention to those who have not seen Benjamin in real life that he is one of the most beautiful looking men on earth inside and out and I'm very privileged to be close to him and his beautiful family.

          <p>Whenever a country is about to choose its representation, at any matter, despite of course focusing on the quality, the choice relates to what’s the most universal in describing the whole nation, what’s the most familiar to the possibly biggest amount of people.
<br />In this case we’re choosing a representation of our planet. We, inhabitants of the Earth, have a very special occasion to pick a piece a music that is not only amazing but also not limited to only one region or one cultural influence. We’re about to choose music that represents us all.
<br />For obvious reasons I can’t think of a better choice than mr. Benjamin Skepper – a contemporary multi-talented artist who doesn’t seem to belong to any particular country or even continent.
<br />When it comes to the history of music – and art in general – his perspicacity cannot be compared to anything else. He’s just a phenomenon. At the same time he’s transcendent and deeply immersed in what humanity is all about. He’s above limits in the way he thinks, being detached from standards, commitments and sentiments and at the same time yearning for all that. The music he creates is the very precious result of that.</p>

          <p>This lovely work composed by the talented Benjamin Skepper would be perfectly at home travelling into the unknown.  In a sense this is a pastiche work between different ancient philosophical and musical practices that like all deep thinkers were and  are looking for meaning in something ephemeral, and grasping creatively and lovingly at immortality in an existence that is ultimately unsustainable and over in a blink of an eye. 
<br />Sending this into space would be a  poetic extension of what all these ancient works were trying to achieve.</p>
