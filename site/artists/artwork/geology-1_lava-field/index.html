  <meta property="og:description" content="Geology is an audio-visual media project, composed of 11 short films about geologicscapes, focusing on the evolving aesthetics of the telluric as an active force and organic manifestation in a constant process of transmutation to be observed, comprehended and contemplated. Geology#1_ Lava Field is the first of the series of the 11 short films, whose here is being presented an extract.  It was produced in Super 8 &amp; HD and it was shot in the area of Gjástykki in Iceland. Each film focuses on an element (ice, magma, water…) in an attempt to unveil several dimensions of their organic manifestations, through intensive audio-visual observation.
The sound of the films is produced with a theremin, used for being an instrument that amplifies the sound of etherwaves. Ether, in this project, is considered an element through which sound and data information are propagated.
This project forces discoveries concerning geology as a determinant subject pursuing to unveil the unknown mechanisms of life and therefor focusing on the dynamics of the telluric with the aim of revealing the expressivity of the Earth in its organic manifestations in a constant state of transformation. The Geology project assembles with raw images and sounds an apparent demonstration of the affinity and
analogy between recently formed landscapes and post-apocalyptic ones, promoting a direct correlation with the purpose of the Forever Now project, where the promotion of posthumous traces of the mankind can be the same of Earth itself in the eventuality of one day drifting to disappearance.

      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Darr Tah Lei is a telluric artist who, based on a research on geology, seeks to aesthetically fundament the super string theory, post-duality theories and trans-humanism. Due to the uncertainty of these zones of observation she frequently falls into a certain abyss of abstraction, which drives her to establish a formal logic between chaos and order and to work with concrete and raw materials. She re-appropriates and transforms the sculptural character of raw and semi-raw natural resources, dislocating their rawness and geologic brutality to the exhibitive art spaces through installations, moving image and photography, sculpture and sound art.
She works mainly in Iceland, place with a bursting geologic potential that contributes to her research and boosts her volumetric production.</p>

<p>Darr Tah Lei has exhibited in Iceland, Germany, and Portugal and her films have been screened in prestigious festivals such as Festival International du Court Métrage, Clermont-Ferrand in France, In-Sonora in Madrid and FILE, Electronic Language International Festival, Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
