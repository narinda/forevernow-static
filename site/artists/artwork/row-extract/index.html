      <div class="artwork-bio copy">
        <p>Andreas Oskar Hirsch (b. 1972) studied film at the Université Paul Valéry in Montpellier, as well as visual arts at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne, where he graduated in 2001 under Jürgen Klauke. He researches beyond the boundaries of various media and produces visual works, sound, music, and texts. His interests therein lie particularly in strategies of translation and conveyance of meaning, absurd experimental setups and the development of imaging, sound-based and performative processes. Themes of decline and failure play as much of a role as do ideas of the beautiful and the perfect. In the course of his experimental enquiry into systems of signs and connotation, order and disorder collide in various constellations again and again, producing friction and occasionally humour.</p>

<p>Since the end of the 1990s, Hirsch has made various inventions and constructions in the field of instrument-building. He has given musical performances and concerts centred around the E-Wedel (Electric Palm Leaf) – a palm leaf he electrified and modified. Since 2011, he has worked with Morse code, the “dead language of the digital age”, as futurologist Paul Saffo wrote in his blog in 2006.</p>

<p>Projects and performances, among others, with Scoli Acosta, Peter Behrendsen, Richard Eigner, Tobias Grewenig, Volker Hennes, Echo Ho, Hannes Hoelzl, Balz Isler, Matthias Muche, Joker Nies, Sytze Pruiksma, Julia Scher.</p>

<p>Exhibitions and performances include The Watermill Center / NY, La Nuit Blanche / Paris, Triangle France / Marseille, Kunsthalle Fridericianum / Kassel, Galerie Schmidt &amp; Handrup / Cologne, Oerol Festival / Terschelling, Skolska Gallery / Prague, Museum Ostwall / Dortmund, A4 / Bratislava, Extrapool / Nijmegen, Kanepes Kultura Centrs / Riga.</p>

<p>Andreas O. Hirsch has been teaching numerous classes in the field of visual arts and music. He was a lecturer at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne from 2008 to 2012. Projects and travels have led him through Europe, to Ukraine, Morocco, China and the USA. He lives and works in Cologne, Germany.</p>

          <p>Hi David, </p>

<p>thank you for your positive comment.</p>

<p>I don't quite agree to one point, though, and so I'd like to add a little note: Maybe I am getting something wrong, but the word 'manipulation' seems a bit odd to me in this context. What you hear is a pure field recording taken from the bow of the boat - quiet a bulky one in fact, like a lifeboat. The steersman sitting opposite side of me. This is an extract of a longer recording, no edting or anything in this extract. The whole trip took almost 2 hours. </p>

<p>Greets, Andreas

          <p>Ups, sorry David - after sending off my comment I realized I had put down the information "editing" myself along with the credits, which was actually a mistake, since editing only applies to the long version of the piece, which compresses the full recording into around 45 minutes by cutting out certain parts. Cheers & Greets, Andreas</p>
