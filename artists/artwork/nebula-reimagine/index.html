  <meta property="og:description" content="I wrote this song as a part of my independently self-released debut EP &lsquo;Reimaginations from A Different Universe&rsquo;.

It tries to artistically combine elements of orchestral music with bits and pieces of electronic music, not just because it seemed to suit the mood of the entire album in particular but also because it tries to bring together the chaotic (electronic) and calm (orchestral) parts of the universe we live in.

The mood of the track is supposed to promote wonder and curiosity in the sense of an awakening of the power of the human imagination which has no limits or boundaries, the same sense of wonder that makes human beings reach out to the stars and discover new things about the universe, both outside and inside within us.
