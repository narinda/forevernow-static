  <meta property="og:description" content="Pica
(Cosmos n [English]: cosmos nm [Español])

As an attempt to embody a non-native language by repeatedly ingesting words; every day, I sit down in front of my English/Spanish dictionary and, in alphabetical order, I pick up a word; I then cut out the English portion and eat it.

Pica is a performance I began in 2009, a few weeks after arriving to the U.S., which I have chosen to send to the outer space as a symbolic statement to: (1) immortalize the artwork and with it the absurd gesture of swallowing English words, and (2) to communicate to extraterrestrials the complexity of the triad culture/ language/ body innate in humans.

Thus, in the spirit of the Voyager Golden Record to depict the life of humans in Earth, this performance refers to the impenetrability of non-native language and the condition of linguistic and cultural alienation inherent to the exilic condition. Likewise, the work metaphorically portraits how humans are not only what we eat, but so are the words and language(s) we speak, as our emotional and neurological selves are configured by the very language that we utter.
