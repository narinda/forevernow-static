  <meta property="og:description" content="&ldquo;Gigaanum Dawn Chorus&rdquo; is a sonicscape which  straddles  worlds between the human voice, bird song and space. Jo Truman connects with the world of birds through her microtonal vocal techniques, creates &ldquo;flocking&rdquo; textures and other sounds and textures which,within a collaborative compositional process between  Jo  and Thomas Knox Arnold,&lsquo; utllises his  magic box of electronica.
The work moves between the disembodied and embodied voice, imagineering worlds of  bird-like beings weaving throughout deep space. A subtle reference to a heart beat near the conclusion of our piece returns us to the the human factor.

        <p>Josephine Truman is a singer, composer and performer whose focus is the voice and its ultimate potentials. Truman was commissioned by the curator of MONA FOMA, Brian Ritchie to compose and perform two works at the MONA FOMA 2013 festival in Hobart. In collaboration with Lennie Marks (electric guitar) and Daniel Grinvalds (electronics) as a singer and pianist )also working with electronics on stage) she peformed a 30 minute work Dream Slash Nightmare at the Princes Wharf in Hobart. The following day she performed Elements (inspiried by the themes of earth, fire air and water) as part of the Morning Meditation series at the St Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral Centre in Hobart, followed by well attended a vocal workshop at the Bahai Centre.</p>

<p>In 2014 Truman received a New Work grant from the Australia Council of the Arts to collaborate on the creation of a kammer opera for solo voice woodwind and strings with the Icelandic composer Hildigunnur Runnardottir. In this capacity Truman is the librettist, composer and singer. Also involved in the creative process is Thomas Knox Arnold, who is collaborating with Truman on an electronics component and related compositional processes. The work is to be performed at festivals in Iceland in 2015.</p>
