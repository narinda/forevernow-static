  <meta property="og:description" content="An audovisual surround sound and collaborative work by NAFF (Mexico). This work is designed for surround sound, binaural sound and 3D visuals. It is a representative message from earth to aliens about deep human emotion, passion for life, fascination for what we do not understand, and about time structure and the spatiotemporal continuum as one of our deepest questions (perhaps forever unresolved). So, we ask you aliens: do you have two ears? (if you do, the message is delivered, it will speak for itself).

        <p>NAFF [chusma] is a new multichannelrock project that mixes electroacoustic music, classical contemporary music and alternative/progressive rock music in an 8 channel concert format and 3D sound recording formats. The &lsquo;dislocated sound&rsquo;, &lsquo;moving sound&rsquo;  &lsquo;structured contemplativeness&rsquo;, harmonic rhythms, poly-rhythms and surreal sound are central to NAFF [chusma]&rsquo;s proposal. The images are the result of a collaboration with Muv, Valaklava, NAFFX, Zopilote and T. Lengeling. Within a month of its debut at CutOut FEST, Querétaro, Mexico, NAFF was classified by Marvin Magazine as one of the best new bands of 2013. The core of the project apart from its visual artists already mentioned is conformed by Pablo Gav (composition, piano, sound design and spatialization), Juan Antonio Arévalo (drums and electronic percussion), Alex Vergara (sound design, live processing and spatialization) and Billie Mandoki (vocals and vocal processing).</p>

          <p>Imagine the odds that human culture would be found by extra terrestrial life that was capable of unraveling the electromagnetic waves and experience this, in whatever way they might. The odds are miniscule. But in the off chance this mission was successful, how would you like to be judged upon first contact? By the greatest expressions of scientific and artistic mastery, or by the bleating of religious idiots, the braying of belligerent marketers and a sound track that features nothing but auto-tuned drivel and a beat that a dumb person likes to shake their ass to? This is the real deal: It incorporates notions of space, time, separation, spectral analysis and all the intangibles of art - the part that tickles the reptilian part of our brains. This shows that, in spite of our many failings, we are capable of greatness when we stop fucking around.  Blast off!</p>

          <p>This project captures very well the idea of immersive sound, the way in which us, humans,  experience live music. Since there is nothing compared to music when it comes to emotional expression, and emotions are the very thing that makes us human, I can't think of a better piece of artwork to represent our planet.</p>

          <p>This is a one of a kind music experience. The music, the use of great mapping video techniques together with sound diffusion makes Naff one of the most innovative and interesting performances I have seen recently. I round the Mexican Centre for Music and Sonic Arts and  their recent concert was by far one of the best this season.</p>

          <p>NAFF bring to mind a quote - by Victor Hugo, I think: “Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent." I saw Pablo Gav perform in London back in the day. It was a great show. But it's clear  he and his bandmates have pushed on a long way since then. Spectacular stuff. </p>

          <p>When listening to music produced by NAFF key phrases that come mind are energetic sound, rhythmical prowess, and meaningful communicative power. I believe, any being will hear and sense a multitude of strands when listening to this intensely talented band/collaboration. Personally, it is like all my musical experiences and influences have been stimulated in a structured temporal setting through juxtaposition and superimposition of sound. Furthermore, from a societal perspective, the music presented by NAFF reflects a sophisticated and diverse culture.</p>

          <p>A different approach to our perception of sound, combined with the visuals, take us to a whole new level of experience. NAFF offers an outstanding project, with an amazing background and  lots of complexity in its creation. I consider it something different, an escape from the usual; definitely worth enjoying. </p>

          <p>Ok, these guys mean business! Their project is ambitious, crazy (as good art should be), and technically extravagant. It will not be the first time humanity has sent messages to outer space and maybe it will not be the last but in any case NAFF deserves to have a place in the parlour. If I was alien (well in a sense maybe I am) I would absolutely think about visiting the planet that delivered this outerwordly music. I say...go go go..launch!</p>
