after I saw some other entries for this , I realized what they might be asking for   . modern art.  my video is far from that it is conventional in every form possible it doesn&rsquo;t require anyone to use they&rsquo;re grey cells , my message is so clear it&rsquo;s literally been typed in .
so now to come to the point about why I might have uploaded this dear reader . it is because drumroll well I was asked to describe the world and truthfully the world is quite conventional  right now .                                       I decided to describe what is probably considered most important by billions of people across the globe . So important that some could kill others for it and be married in its name , at the same time . Religion , I believe that all problems good and bad have their source from it . from the pope to Allah , we all (well nearly all ) have our beliefs and deep down inside we know how much it means .  it is imperative that we describe this funny phenomenon  of how our race tries to come up with reasons about our existence . thank you for reading this dear user ,it means a lot to the stars . :) (be happy )
