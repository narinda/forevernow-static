  <meta property="og:description" content="Usually, scanning is used to represent images or to read encoded, written messages. Therefore, overexposure to light may be treated as a kind of a potential introspection, a state of concentration, a meeting and exchange with one’s own self. Its intensity develops with time and may get you close to meditation, but it can also take the form of a momentary flash of light, a transient feeling or image. The Artist often tries to reduce the initial idea of her artwork, searching for its optimum form based on clarity, simplification and focus. Similarly to her previous works: Cave, Iridescent and Enter Me, she designs a space of experience constructed at the intersection between visual, architectural and sculptural actions.

The Artists interest in light, time and space is not formalistic in character, it&rsquo;s rather situated close to various spiritual methods and practices aimed, on the one hand, at deepening self-knowledge, purification and, as the Artist herself claims, &ldquo;deprogramming;&rdquo; and on the other hand: at exploring the world of nature and science, and going beyond oneself and others, towards a transcendental experience.
